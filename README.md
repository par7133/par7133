<b>Alert #1</b>: In old Mac it is a tough time to browse LetsEncrypt websites. Here I explain you how to deal with it.  
How-to: Let LetsEncrypt certificates being validated in MacOSX < 10.12 (old versions)  
- Download the ISRG Root X1 self-signed certificate from https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/  
- Open the certificate app ‚ÄúKeychain Access‚Äù from Applications/Utilities  
- Add (+) the ISRG Root X1 certificate above in ‚ÄúSystem‚Äù  
- Go in File->Get Info to set its trust preferences for SSL to ‚ÄúAlways trust‚Äù  
Enjoy!

<b>Alert #2</b>: In your double sim cards mobile, I suggest you to use the double sim cards mode 
because I'm tempted to think that (at 2024/07) it consumes less than the mono mode.
