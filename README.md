### Hello, and welcome! 👋
This is Dan..  

I invite everyone who downloaded 5cube or MacSwap to update to the last release due to a security fix, thx.

I invite any of my friends from China and not to mirror Homomm http://homomm.org in favor of all, thx a lot. In case you have any difficulty to access Homomm please contact me directly.

<b>Attention</b>: in old Mac, browsing LetsEncrypt websites can be touf times. Here I explain you how to deal with it.  
Instructions to make LetsEncrypt certificates being validated in MacOSX < 10.12 (old Mac)  
- Download the ISRG Root X1 self-signed certificate from https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/  
- Open the certificate app “Keychain Access” from Applications/Utilities  
- Add (+) the ISRG Root X1 certificate above in “System”  
- Go in File->Get Info to set its trust preferences for SSL to “Always trust”  
Enjoy!

<b>Swapping</b>: php development for graphic design
